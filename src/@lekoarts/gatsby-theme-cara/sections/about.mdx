<div class=" css-1lbpowx"><h2 class="css-fymmpb">About</h2><blockquote class="css-1dn5l20"><p class="css-v5ivh2">I started my development life and eCommerce journey in the year 2000 by managing a small team of developers in a startup agency.</p></blockquote><p class="css-v5ivh2">Further to a successful internal eCommerce project in 2005 I became part developer (primarily .net), part merchant and took over ownership of the business in 2007. Following on from I grew the eCommerce property to be a leader in its sector whilst continuing to lead development on complex integrations with third party services.
</p><p class="css-v5ivh2">Subsequently I provided eCommerce consultancy services for SMEs and in 2012 I co-founded one of UK's leading Magento agencies where I was the CTO for 5 yrs. In this position I managed a development team responsible for Enterprise level solutions. Deciding to resign in April 2017 I initially provided consultancy services to a select group of merchants where by I assisted with developing eCommerce strategies and implemented best practice development processes. I now hold the postitions noted above.
