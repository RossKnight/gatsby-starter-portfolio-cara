<h2>About</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>I started my development and eCommerce journey in the year 2000 when I began managing a small team of developers in a startup agency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further to a successful internal "print on demand" eCommerce project in 2005 we pivoted the business to become a manufacturer / merchant and I took ownership in 2007. Following on from this I grew the eCommerce property to be a market leader in its sector whilst and became increasingly involved with technical aspects of complex third party integrations.</p>
<p>Subsequently I provided eCommerce consultancy on this subject for SMEs and in 2012 I co-founded one of UK's leading Magento agencies where I was the CTO for 5 years. In this position I managed a development team responsible for Enterprise level solutions. Deciding to resign in April 2017 I initially provided consultancy services to a select group of merchants whereby I assisted with developing eCommerce strategies and implemented best practice development processes. I now hold the postitions noted above.</p>
