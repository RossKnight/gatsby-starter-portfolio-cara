<h2>About</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>I started my development life and eCommerce journey in the year 2000 by managing a small team of developers in a startup agency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further to a successful internal eCommerce project in 2005 I became part developer (primarily .net), part merchant and took over ownership of the business in 2007. Following on from I grew the eCommerce property to be a leader in its sector whilst continuing to lead development on complex integrations with third party services.</p>
<p>Subsequently I provided eCommerce consultancy services for SMEs and in 2012 I co-founded one of UK's leading Magento agencies where I was the CTO for 5 yrs. In this position I managed a development team responsible for Enterprise level solutions. Deciding to resign in April 2017 I initially provided consultancy services to a select group of merchants where by I assisted with developing eCommerce strategies and implemented best practice development processes. I now hold the postitions noted above.</p>
